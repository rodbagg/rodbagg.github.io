# ZEBRIUM OVERVIEW 
We use unsupervised machine learning on logs and metrics to automatically catch the "leading edge" of critical application and system problems. This lets us find problems earlier than traditional monitoring and logging tools and shrinks the time to resolution. We've specifically designed this to detect related problems that impact multiple services, in a way that minimizes alert noise.
